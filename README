    I  was looking for a comfortable way to read and write ID3 tags
    in PERL and found the MP3::Info package at CPAN which does quite
    a good job.

    Unfortunately it lacked support for writing ID3V2 tags.

    So I looked again at CPAN and found the MP3::Tag package which 
    supports it, but has a somewhat lower-level interface than MP3::Info.
    My application was halfway written and already used 
    MP3::Info::set_mp3tag calls, so I wrote a little wrapper which 
    provides the set_mp3v2tag routine quite similar to 
    MP3::Info::set_mp3_tag.

    It expects the filename as argument 1 and a hash-reference as
    argument 2.

    I am not really an expert in MP3-tags, and this little wrapper
    completely relys on MP3::Tag and my - may be not so perfect - 
    understanding of it. Still I hope there are no disastrous bugs 
    in this software.
